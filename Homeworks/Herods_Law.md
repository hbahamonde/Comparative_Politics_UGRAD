## Pop Quiz 4: Herod's Law.

##### Your Name

___________

**Read the following motivation**. First, in Mexico, political opposition was not really prohibited. There were periodical elections, and also, PRI representatives seemed to really care about PAN opponents, such as "Dr. Morales," as shown in the movie. Second, the constitution and the rule of law seem to be, at least, considered (neither the President, nor Vargas were "above" the law). In fact, and third, Mexican politics was (or has been) ruled for a long time by the following principle (sometimes attributed to Benito Juarez): "to my friends everything, to my enemies the law."

##### Now, answer the next two questions


1. The movie takes place in Mexico, somewhere 1946 and 1952, when Miguel Aleman was the president. Using the definition provided Levtisky and Way, and according to the movie, was Mexico a "competitive authoritarianism"? Why? Why not? Explain. [Two paragraphs max.]

2. Consider the following two points. First, Juan Vargas is sent to this town called "San Pedro de los Saguaros" to bring *de jure* institutions such as the rule of law, justice and modernization. He even has the **willingness** to do his best, too, at least at the beginning. However, the town is ruled by other *de facto* institutions such as corruption, bribery, among others. Second, the movie is entitled "Herod's Law." The literal meaning is this: "either you get scr--- or you get fu---" ("o te chingas o te jodes"). Considering the examples provided by Levtisky and Way, explain how ruling parties, in these kinds of regimes, use *de jure* institutions to stack the deck in their own favor.  [Three paragraphs max.]
