##### Your Name

___________


1. In studying hybrid regimes, many studies are said to have a "democratizing bias." Define what that is. Then, answer the next question: *Are hybrid regimes better defined as diminished forms of democracy, or diminished form of authoritarianism*? Why? Explain. [Two paragraphs max.].
2. Terms such as "semidemocratic" and "semi-authoritarian" are said to be "residual." That is, cases that can't be easily defined or classified, are sent to this "others" typology. Do you consider "competitive authoritarianism," as a concept, "residual"? Why? Why not? [One paragraph max.]
3. Imagine you work as a consultant or analyst, and that you currently are working on a project that requires you to *operationalize* competitive authoritarian regimes. Levitsky and Way recommend: "*In competitive authoritarian regimes [...] violations of [democratic] criteria are both  frequent enough and serious enough to create an uneven playing field between government and opposition*." How can you quantitatively measure what "frequent enough" and "serious enough" are? [Two paragraphs max.]
