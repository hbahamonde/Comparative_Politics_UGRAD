## Preface

"To sump up as concisely as possible, we seek to understand the role of the landed upper classes and the peasants in the bourgeois revolutions leading to capitalist democracy, the abortive bourgeois revolutions leading to fascism, and the peasant revolutions leading to communism."

"The ways in which the landed upper classes and the peasants reacted to the challenge of commercial agriculture were decisive factors in determining the political outcome."

## Ch. 1


1. There was a capitalization process of the land: "the medieval notion of judging economic actions according to their contribution to the health of the social organism began to collapse. Men ceased to see the agrarian problem as a question of finding the best method of supporting people on the land and began to perceive it as the best way on investing capital in the land. They began to treat land more and more as as something that could be bought and sold, used and abused, in a word like modern capitalist private property."

"Simultaneously the commercialization of agriculture meant a change from the feudal seigneur who was at worse a lawless tyrant and at best a despotic parent to an overlord who was closer to an acute man of business exploiting the material resources of the estate with an eye to profit and efficiency."

"The yeomen were the chief force behind peasant enclosures."

"yeomen": "a group of ambitious, aggressive, small capitalists, aware that they had not enough surplus to take great risk, mindful that the gain is often as much in the saving as in the spending, but determined to take advantage of every opportunity, whatever its origin, for increasing their profits."

from internet: "common and waste strips. Common and waste land were used for grazing animals and as a source of wood."

Enclosures
==========

- from internet: "Before enclosure, much farmland existed in the form of numerous, dispersed strips under the control of individual cultivators only during the growing season and until harvesting was completed for a given year. Thereafter, and until the next growing season, the land was at the disposal of the community for grazing by the village livestock and for other purposes. To enclose land was to put a hedge or fence around a portion of this open land and thus prevent the exercise of common grazing and other rights over it."

from the internet: "Though the enclosure movement was practical in organizing land among wealthy landowners it also had a negative impact on peasant farmers. It caused massive urbanization as many farmers were forced to give up their shares of the land to wealthy landowners and move into the cities in search of work."

"encroachments made by lords of manors or their farmers upon the land over which the manorial population had common rights or which lay in the open arable fields."

From Wikipedia: "enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm. Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (enclosed) and deeded or entitled to one or more owners. "

"Propelled by the prospect of profits to be made either in selling wool or by leasing their lands to those who did and thereby increasing their rents, the lords of the manors found a variety of legal and semilegal methods to deprive the peasants of their rights of cultivation in the open fields and also their rights to use the common for pasture of their cattle, the collection of wood for fuel, and the like."

"the enclosures were the final blow that destroyed the whole structure of English peasant society embodied in the traditional village." because "innumerable peasants lost their rights on the common lands of the villages as the great landlords absorbed these lands."

"The outcome of the Civil war itself, in sharp contrast of that of the French Revolution, was to strengthen greatly the position of the landed upper classes."

causes efficiencies on land usage: "this was an age of improvement in agricultural techniques, such as the increased use of fertilizer, new crops, and crop rotation. New methods could not be applied at all in fields subject to the rules of common cultivation; their expense made them harder for the farmer of small and even diddling means."


* end of enclosures meant the destruction of the peasantry:
  - "landless laborers [...] had only customary but not legal usage of the common, the loos of this right or privilege meant disaster."
  - "when the common fields disappeared and a new economic system began to win out in the countryside, the old peasant community finally gave away and disintegrated."
  - "the enclosures greatly strengthened the larger landlords and broke the back of the English peasantry, **eliminating them as a factor from British political life**."


English Revolution
==================

- "The war itself eliminated the king as the last protection of the peasantry against the encroachments of the landed upper classes."
- Enclosures threatened the landlord's property rights.
- "the Civil war swept away the main barrier to the enclosing landlord and simultaneously prepared England for rule by a 'committee of landlords.'"
- "The connection between the enclosing landlord and the bourgeoisie was close and intimate to the point where it is often difficult to decide where the one begins and the other leaves off in the ramified family circles of the day."
- "the outcome of the struggle was an enormous if still incomplete victory for an alliance between parliamentary democracy and capitalism." (he refers to the alliance between the bourgeoisie and the landed elites.)


## Ch. 7 (413-433)

"Routes to the modern world"

1) "the bourgeois revolution": UK, France, US. "the fusion take place in opposition to the royal bureaucracy."
2) also capitalist. "in the absence of a strong revolutionary surge, it passed through reactionary political forms to culminate in fascism." -> revolution from above.
3) communist route. "Russian and China." -> revolution from below.

- "No bourgeois, no democracy" (p. 418).



### Notes

- end of feudalism.
- role of democratic values? no. it's an structural argument. forces outside of the individual "determine" individual behavior.
- did it catch your attention that democracy was not artifact born to represent the popular classes? It's an alliance between the buraguasie.

- very sociological: what's the sub-unit of analysis? (classes, not individuals).
  - nobles
  - peasants
  - bourgeoisie

- ver estamentos. \\ sociedad estamental.

- cases: France, England, the United States, Japan, China, and India, with some occasional references to Germany and Russia as well

Routes
- (1) the capitalist democratic route, which engenders parliamentary democracy (alliance: aristocracy & bourgeoisie):  England, France, and the United States.  The urban bourgeoisie emerged as the most economically and politically powerful actor, and the aristocracy either did not oppose its democratizing efforts or it was destroyed by it in a bourgeois revolution
- (2) the capitalist-reactionary route, which engenders fascist dictatorship; and
- (3) the communist route, which engenders communist dictatorship
