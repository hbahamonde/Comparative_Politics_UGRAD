# Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy
# Lipset1959

"Two principal complex characteristics of social systems will be considered here as they bear on the problem of stable democracy: economic development ["comprising industrialization, wealth, urbanization, and education"] and legitimacy ["degree to which institutions are valued for themselves, and considered right and proper"]. These will be presented as structural characteristics of a society which sustain a democratic political system."


"the more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy."

"The higher one's education, the more likely one is to believe in democratic values and support democratic practices."

"All the relevant studies indicate that education is far more significant than income or occupation."

"If we cannot say that a "high" level of education is a sufficient condition for democracy, the available evidence does suggest that it comes close to being a necessary condition in the modern world."

higher levels of education "will reduce the intensity of [the poor's] commitment to given ideologies and make them less receptive to sup- porting extremist ones."



## Methodological Advances

1. one of the first papers in poli sci in using numbers and correlations: "it is only through such methods that we can move beyond the conventional semi-literary methods of giving illustrative examples to support plausible interpretations."
2. published in the best poli sci journal.

# Modernization: Theories and Facts
# Przeworski1997


"What makes political regimes rise, endure, and fall? Do democracies emerge as a consequence of economic Does development? Does rapid economic growth destabilize democracies? Is there some level of development beyond which democracies are more likely to fall?"

"In fact, transitions are increasingly likely as per capita income of dictatorships rises but only until it reaches a level of about $6,000. Above that, dictatorships become more stable as countries become more affluent."

"The probability that a democracy will die during any particular year in a country with an income above $4,000 is practically zero."

They say their theory is more "agency" (like O'Donell's theory) than "structural" (Moore's theory): "the emergence of democracy is not a by-product of economic development. Democracy is or is not established by political actors pursuing their goals, and it can be initiated at any level of development. Only once it is established do economic constraints play a role: he chances for the survival of democracy are greater when the country is richer."
