# Does Democracy Make a Difference?



# Political Regimes and Economic Growth
1. Does democracy in the political realm foster or hinder economic growth?: "political institutions do matter for growth, but thinking in terms of regimes does not seem to capture the relevant differences." "while Latin American democracies suffered economic disasters during the 1980s, the world is replete with authoritarian regimes that are dismal failures from the economic point of view. Hence, it does not seem to be democracy or authoritarianism per se that makes the difference but something else."

2. "The property rights literature treats the state as the only source of potential threat. But property rights are threatened by private actors: capitalist property is threatened by organized workers, landlords' property by landless peasants. It is by no means clear that the villain is necessarily "the ruler." Indeed, one liberal dilemma is that a strong state is required to protect property from private encroachments but a strong state is a potential threat itself."

3. talk about
  1. median voter theorem and distributional conflicts // Meltzer and Richard (1981).
  2. this paper is more valuable for his theoretical contribution, not for its methodological analyses.
  3. endogeneity problem (chicken/egg) (1) present AR model (politics -> economics -> success) and (2) the Lipset hypothesis of "requisite" (economics -> politics -> success). This is in p. 62.


## Democracy can't protect property rights, everything depends on the location of the median voter.
4. argument for why democracy can't really protect property rights: democracy can be used to expropriate the rich, taking away their property rights. In their words: "since democracy offers those who are poor, oppressed or otherwise miserable as a consequence of the initial distribution of endowments an opportunity to find redress via the state. Endowed with political power in the form of universal suffrage, those who suffer as a consequence of private property will attempt to use this power to expropriate the riches."

5. Karl Marx expressed the same conviction that private property and universal suffrage are incompatible (1952, p. 62). According to his analysis, democracy inevitably "unchains the class struggle": The poor use democracy to expropriate the riches; the rich are threatened and subvert democracy, typically by "abdicating" political power to the permanently organized armed forces.

## Democracy can't produce growth due to consumption structure of the postdoctoral
"The chain of reasoning is the following: (1) poor people want to consume immediately; (2.1) when workers can organize, they drive wages up, reduce profits, and reduce investment (either by lowering the rate of return or the volume of profit or both) and (2.2) when people can vote, governments distribute incomes away from investment (either they tax and transfer or they undertake less public investment); and (3) lowering investment slows down growth."


## Dictatorships are able to insulate the state, and thus, they perform better economically

"Since authoritarian political arrangements give political elites autonomy from distributionist pressures, they increase the government's ability to extract re- sources, provide public goods, and impose the short-term costs associated with efficient economic adjustment." // This is from Haggard (cited in the paper)."


"This argument takes two steps: "state autonomy" favors growth, and "state autonomy" is possible only under authoritarianism. State autonomy enhances economic performance because: (1) the state has a role to play to make the economy function efficiently;" (2) the state must be insulated from private pressures if it is to perform this role well; and (3) the state apparatus wants to perform this role well.

# Is Democracy Good for the Poor? (Ross2006)

1. "democracy has little or no effect on infant and child mortality rates"

2. "Democracies spend more money on education and health than nondemocracies, but these benefits seem to accrue to middle-and upper-income groups."

3. "There is good evidence that democracies fund public services at a higher level than nondemocracies [...] But it is not obvious that these infusions of money actually reach the poor; nor is it obvious that they produce better social outcomes, such as longer, healthier, or more productive lives."

4. Selection bias: "This article suggests that past studies of democracy and the poor have been flawed by a surprising form of selection bias: most cross-national studies omit from their samples nondemocratic states with good economic and social records, which creates the false impression that democracies have outperformed nondemocracies." **that's why it's important to include ALL cases**

## In Favor of democracy

1. Sen:
  1. Electoral mechanism: "democracies, through the electoral process, allow the poor to penalize governments that allow famines to occur."
  2. Democracies correct asymmetries of information: "democracies are better than nondemocracies at transmitting information from poor and remote areas to the central government, thanks to freedom of the press."

3. "democracies tend to help the poor by producing more public goods, and more income redistribution, than nondemocracies. According to some scholars, democracies produce more public goods because they are forced by the electoral process to spend their revenues on government services, while autocratic governments face no such constraint."

## Meltzer-Richard model

1. distributional effects of democracy:
  1. median income with restricted voting rights: high.
  2. median income under full citizenship: low.
  3. "In short, democracy brings more people with below-average incomes to the polls, and they collectively force the government to redistribute income downwards."
  4. your income determine your political preferences. Most important thing for voters: distribution. The rich want to protect their property. The poor want to expropriate the wealthy's property. Hence, under democracy, the rich vote for candidates that don't distribute, while the poor vote for candidates that promise redistribution (social policy, welfare, etc.).

2. Income is not distributed evenly:
  1. Since it is skewed right, the mean income will exceed the median income. That is, when income is unequally distributed, the median income is less than the mean income. Under unequal distribution, the median voter will earn the median income.
3. Why "median" and not "mean"? the median voter is the decisive person. The median is the 50th percentile. If you know who this person is, you target your programmatic offer to this person. The adjacent people will vote for you.
4. the median income is the dictator's income. It determines
