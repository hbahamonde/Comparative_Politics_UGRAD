# Geddes (What Do We Know About Democratization After Twenty Years?)

- "classify authoritarian regimes as personalist, military, single-party, or amalgams of the pure types."
- "In military regimes, a group of officers decides who will rule and exercises some influence on policy. In single-party regimes, access to political office and control over policy are dominated by one party, though other parties may legally exist and compete in elections. Personalist regimes differ from both military and single-party in that access to office and the fruits of office depends much more on the discretion of an individual leader."

"Single-party regimes survive in part because their institutional structures make it relatively easy for them to allow greater participation and popular influence on policy without giving up their dominant role in the political system"

"When faced with unexpected problems, military regimes tend to split, personalist regimes to circle the wagons, and single parties to try to coopt their critics. Consequently, violent overthrow is much more likely to end personalist than military or single-party regimes. The modal ending for personalist regimes is a coup, and insurgency, assassination, popular uprising, or invasion are important causes of breakdown in more than half (see Skocpol & Goodwin 1994). Such endings are relatively uncommon for military and single-party regimes. Coups are fairly common in military governments, but they usually do not end the regime. They are primarily a way of changing leadership while maintaining the regime itself."

Because military regimes have more endogenous sources of instability than
do personalist or single-party regimes, they are more fragile. Military regimes in existence at any time between 1946 and the present have lasted on average about 9 years.4 Personalist regimes survived about 15 years on average, and single-party regimes (excluding those maintained by direct foreign occupation or military threat) endured on average almost 23 years.

Survival rates for different types of regime also differ markedly. Only about
11% of the military regimes that have existed since 1946 still exist in 1998. The proportion of surviving personalist regimes is not much higher (15%). In contrast, 50% of single-party regimes continue to exist. The proportion of each type of regime that ended during each five-year period after 1945 is shown in Table 2. This chronological presentation reveals the effects of exogenous shocks, such as the economic crisis of the 1980s, that affect all regimes. On average, the proportion of military regimes that fell during any particular five years between 1945 and 1994 was about 50% higher than the proportion of personalist regimes and about four times the proportion of single-party regimes .

Personalist regimes are less vulnerable to internal splits than are military regimes, but three characteristics make them less robust than single-party regimes. First, personalist regimes rarely survive long after the death of the leader, perhaps because, in their effort to defend themselves from potential rivals, leaders so assiduously eliminate followers who demonstrate high levels of ability and ambition.

Sources of instability: endogenous and exogenous.

Tullock (1987), who argued that all dictators share the same primary goal: hold on to office for dear life because failing to do so will result in jail, exile, or a bullet in the back of the head.


## Questions

**Motivation**: "Holding on to office is, however, extremely difficult because dictators cannot know who supports them and who does not: virtually all constituents and colleagues in dictatorships—at least those who value their necks—profess loyalty to the dictator, even as they conspire to depose him. The net effect is a paradox: dictators are inherently insecure."

You're a dictator:

1. *You've lost credibility and authority: What would be your best strategy to transition to democracy?* (amnesty, self-exile, ) What's an effective way to transition to a democracy?  Geddes argues: "Similarly, efforts to manipulate the future political spectrum have proved both less effective (except in Chile)" [explain the constitution of the 1989]

2. *Would you allow practice of civil rights (elections)?* "Why do some authoritarian governments practice widespread repression, while others permit a surprisingly broad range of civil rights?" (Haber) [explain the case of China].

3. *Would you be a benevolent dictator, and why?* "Why are some authoritarian governments motivated to provide social welfare programs?"
  A. But why can't the dictator offer to be a benign despot? [credible commitments: because there is no sanction for breaking his promises, no promise he makes is credible]
  B. Why is Olson's "stationary model" "wrong"? [because it assumes infinite time horizons, that is, dictators with infinite life. However, they will not have any incentives to respect property rights as they get older. As they get older, they will start expropriating.]
      - Point about eunuchs: they have short time horizons, as they can't have children. Their only concern is to remain in office by being loyal: "seen as more trustworthy and less interested in establishing a private 'dynasty'" [last quote from Wikipedia.]
  C. Why "doing a good job is not enough to ensure political survival?" [Bueno de Mesquita p. 58: "In fact, having competent ministers ... can be a dangerous mistake. Competent people, after all, are potential (and politically competent) rivals."]

4. *You face political and military opposition from within your coalition*.
  A. Would you terrorize the leadership of the launching organization?
  B. Would you co‐opt the leadership of the launching organization?
  C. Would you create a set of rival or complementary organizations with the purpose of raising the cost of collective action for the leadership of the launching organization?


You're the international community:

1. Should we allow dictatorships to emerge?


# Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith

The fundamental premise in selectorate theory is that the primary goal of a leader is to remain in power.

"**Leaders must keep their winning coalition satisfied to stay in power**.": "_Building a small coalition is key to survival. The smaller the number of people to whom a leader is beholden the easier it is for her to persist in office_." P. 72


To remain in power, leaders must maintain their winning coalition:
  - When the winning coalition is small, as in autocracies, the leader will tend to use **private goods** to satisfy the **coalition**.
  - When the winning coalition is large, as in democracies, the leader will tend to use **public goods** to satisfy the coalition. Private goods are better, but it's too expensive to deliver those to a large number of people.

A public good is one that everyone enjoys non-exclusively such as national defense or clean water.

A private good is a good that is enjoyed exclusively by a select few, usually within the winning coalition, and cannot be shared. An example of such a good would be anything exclusionary, such as cash or legal impunity.

In selectorate theory, there are three groups of people that affect leaders' actions: T
   1. "nominal selectorate": every person who has some say in choosing the leader (for example, in an American presidential election, all registered voters).
   2. "real selectorate": those who really choose the leaders (for example, in an American presidential election, those people who cast a vote)
   3. "winning coalition": those whose support translates into victory (for example, in an American presidential election, those voters that get a candidate to 270 Electoral College votes). \\ The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.
