# Intro

Here, we've changed the DV: now, we're not explaining something necessarily political (economy). However, we are explaining something economical, using political variables.

# Sachs, Gallup, Mellinger

- "nearly all countries in the geographic tropics are poor, and almost all countries in the mid- and high latitudes are rich."
- "coastal countries generally have higher incomes than do landlocked countries. Indeed, none of the twenty-nine landlocked countries outside of Europe enjoys a high per capita income."
  - geography also operates through the "level of productivity and transport costs."
  - "A second major dimension of productivity linked to geography is the prevalence of infectious disease. Almost all of the 200 to 500 million annual cases of malaria occur in the tropics."
  - "Many diseases that are carried by mosquitoes (dengue fever, yellow fever, and lymphatic filariasis, in addition to malaria), mollusks (schistosomiasis), and other arthropods (onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, Chagas’s disease, visceral filariasis) are endemic in tropical ecological zones and nearly absent elsewhere."
  - "A third major correlate of geography and productivity is the link between climate and agricultural output. Estimates of agricultural productivity suggest a strong adverse effect of tropical ecozones on the market value of agricultural output after controlling for inputs such as labor, tractors, fertilizer, irrigation, and other inputs. Tropical agriculture suffers a productivity decrement of 30 percent to 50 percent relative to temperate-zone agriculture after controlling as best as possible for factor inputs."
- "Eleven economies in North America,Western Europe, and East Asia contain 14 percent of the world’s population yet are responsible for 88 percent of global exports of capital goods."
- "we find that being located in the Southern Hemisphere reduces average per capita income by $3,590, being located in the sub- tropics reduces income by $4,785, being landlocked reduces income by $5,190, and being socialist reduces income by $10,053."
- "Geography can have another potent effect through its influence on the choice of economic policies. Countries that are close to markets, for example, may choose more open trade policies than countries that are far from markets."

# Address
- issues of reverse causation: malaria kills you because you are poor, or you are poor because you suffer from malaria.
