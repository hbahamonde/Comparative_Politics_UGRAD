# Boix (Intro and Ch. 3)

"increasing levels of economic equality bolster the chances of democracy."

"each political regime has different redistributive consequences."

"[under more egalitarian conditions] the relative costs of tolerating a mass democracy decline for the holders of the most productive assets."

"since the tax they will pay in a democratic regime finally becomes smaller than the cost of repression that they would have to bear to exclude the majority of citizens, they accept the introduction of a system of universal suffrage."

"At very high levels of inequality, the threats posed by democratization are too high to accept and they choose to repress.Yet at low or medium levels of inequality, redistributive demands can be managed through class compromises over institutions and policy that permit democratic transitions" (from Bob's paper).


Boix assumes the rational poor individual to be always in favour of democracy due to its expected benefits from redistribution. Thus the mobilization of the poor, which is by assumption either absent or present, becomes the crucial factor. // from the internet.

## Asset Mobility

"High levels of capital mobility enhance the bargaining power of elites. Fixed assets, by contrast, limit the options of the wealthy and make them vulnerable to democratic redistribution and thus more resistant to it." (from Bob's paper).

"as the ease with which capitalists can escape taxation goes up, their support for an authoritarian solution declines."

"a decline in the extent to which capital cab be either taxed or expropriated as a result of its characteristics also fosters the emergence of a democratic regime. As the mobility of capital increases, tax rates necessarily decline since otherwise capital holders would have an incentive to transfer their assets abroad."

"type of economic assets, that is, the extent to which the assets are mobile or difficult to tax"

"it clarifies why economies with a large proportion of fixed assets, such as the oil countries, remain authoritarian, despite having extremely high levels of per capita income (thus defying the predictions of modernization theory). Second, and more generally, it explains why economic development is associated with the triumph of democracy."

“asset specificity” : a concept denoting the degree to which wealth is tied to a given country and cannot be moved out in order to avoid taxation.

when assets are liquid,  democratization becomes more likely, even if inequality is quite substantial. // from the internet.

On these grounds, Boix argues, economic development is conducive to democratization since it transforms “societies that rely on the exploitation of mines and agricultural land to economies based on manufacturing industries and human capital-intensive businesses” and thus makes capital less taxable. // from the internet.




## Talk about

- credible commitments in Acemoglu and Robinson's theory: "When elites are confronted by mobilization from below, they can make short-run economic concessions to diffuse the threat. Yet politically and economically excluded groups are aware that elites can renege on these concessions when pressures from below subside. Because there is a cost to subsequently reversing democracy after a transition has occurred, democratic institutions provide a means for elites to credibly commit to a more equal distribution of resources not only in the present but into the future as well." (from Bob's paper).


# Bob's paper

"Using an extremely generous definition of “distributive conflict” transitions, we find that between55%and 58% of the democratic transitions during this period conformed—even very loosely—to the causal mechanisms specified in the distributive conflict models.Thus, even with an expansive definition of distributive conflict, more than 40% did not conform at all."

"We show that the support for the distributive conflict model of regime change is weak, even under highly generous coding rules."

"a substantial number of the distributive conflict transitions occurred under conditions of high inequality."


"we find several alternative causal pathways to democratic rule.

(1) External actors were decisive in some cases.
(2) Other domestic causal factors induced incumbents to relinquish power in the absence of strong challenges from below:
  (2.1) Elite incumbents were sometimes challenged by elite outgroups or defectors from the ruling coalition who saw gains from democratic openings.
  (2.2) Elite incumbents ceded power in the absence of mass pressure because they believed they could control the design of democratic institutions in ways that protected their material interests."

"In the first instance, we seek to establish whether distributive conflict is present or not and, if so, whether and how it affects the decisions that result in or constitute regime change."
