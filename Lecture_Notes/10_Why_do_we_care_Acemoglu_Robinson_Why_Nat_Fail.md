# Why Nations Fail, Ch. 3.
====================

- Situate this *popular* book within a broader scientific context/theory about development, democracy, and economy.
- North and South Korea: logic of an experiment: the doctor and pharmacist brothers.
  - centrality of institutions: natural experiment (controls for culture, language, etc.). The treatment is institutions: "neither culture nor geography nor ignorance can explain the divergent paths of North and South Korea. We have to look at institutions for an answer."
- "Lack if private property meant that few people had incentives to invest or to exert effort to increase or even maintain productivity."
- think about the Robing and Stationary Bandits. *extractive* v. *inclusive*. Mix this with democracy.

# Innovation and Property Rights


- "Secure property rights are central, since only those with such rights will be willing to invest and increase productivity. A business man who expects his output to be stolen, expropriated, or entirely taxed away will have little incentive to work, let alone any incentive to undertake investments and innovations."

- "Those who have good ideas will be able to start businesses, workers will tend to go to activities where their productivity is greater, and less efficient firms can be replaced by more efficient ones." *"paradise" slide*

- mechanism: inclusive political institutions -> inclusive economic institutions -> nation don't fail.

- "These improvements follow from science and from entrepreneurs such as Thomas Edison, who applied science to create profitable businesses [...] It should therefore be no surprise that it was the U.S. society, not Mexico or Peru, that produced Thomas Edison, and that it was South Korea, not North Korea, that today produces technologically innovative companies such as Samsung and Hyundai."

- "Nations fail when they have extractive economic institutions, supported by extractive political institutions that impede and even block economic growth."


# Inclusiveness.

- "To be inclusive, economic institutions must feature secure property rights, an unbiased system of law, and a provision of public services that provides a level playing field in which people can exchange and contract."

- "We will refer to political institutions that are sufficiently centralized and pluralistic as inclusive political institutions. When either of these conditions fails, we will refer to the institutions as extractive political institutions."

- "[the] synergistic relationship between extractive economic and political institutions introduces a strong feedback loop: political institutions enable the elites controlling the political power to choose economic institutions with few constraints or opposing forces."

- "Inclusive economic institutions, in turn, are forged on foundations laid by inclusive political institutions, which make power broadly distributed in society and constrain its arbitrary exercise."

- Can growth be produced under non-inclusive institutions? "[Inclusive] Economic institutions that create incentives for economic progress may simultaneously redistribute income and power in such a way that a predatory dictator and others with political power ma become worse off."
